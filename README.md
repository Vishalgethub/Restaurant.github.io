**BEM methodology**
Structured code that's easy to understand and easily scalable

**Sass**
Enabled me to break different components down into separate Sass files, with the potential to re-use elements in future projects.

**CSS Grid & Flexbox**
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.

**JavaScript**
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.

**Express Server**
Once the Sass and Font-Awesome files were bundled into a single CSS file, I created a simple Express server so that I could deploy the app online.
